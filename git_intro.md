## Material

### What is Git?

If you need to collaborate on a project, a script, some code or a document, there are a few ways to operate. Sending a file back and forth and taking turns is not efficient; a cloud-based office suite requires a connection to the Internet and doesn't usually keep a clean record of contributions.

**Version control** allows users to:

* record a clean history of changes;
* keep track of who did what;
* go back to previous versions;
* work offline; and
* resolve potential conflicts.

Programmers use version control systems to collaborativelly write code all the time, but it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can be stored in a version control system.

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a **commit**), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a **repository**. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people.


### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a Git host server which stores your Git repository online. This means that you can easily use this platform to share your work, find the work of others, and collaborate. There are many other Git host servers such as GitLab and BitBucket.

Once you have created a GitHub account,

### Creating a Repository

You can create a repository within an already existing folder for a project you're already working on, or you can create a new folder and repository when you begin your project.
Let's create a new folder for our project today.

Open GitHub Desktop 
Create folder

Set the repository

Create a file in R

### Tracking Changes

Commit the file

Pusblish/Push the File to Github

Edit the file

Push again

View and edit online

Fetch/Pull

Delete

Push

Revert

Gitignore
